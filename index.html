<b>Introduction</b>
<br/>
<br/>
Over the past decade, there has been rising interest in research on dynamic multiobjective optimisation. This is a challenging yet highly important topic that addresses problems with multiobjective and time-varying characteristics. Due to the existence of dynamics, dynamic multiobjective optimization problems (DMOPs) are inherently more complex and demanding than static multiobjective problems, presenting considerable challenges to evolutionary algorithms (EAs) when solving them. Broadly speaking, DMOPs bring about at least three main challenges. First, environmental changes are hard to detect. If they go undetected, they can mislead the search process because nondominated solutions identified for the previous environment may no longer be valid in the current one. Second, Diversity, which acts as the primary driving force of population-based algorithms, is highly sensitive to dynamics. The dynamic nature of DMOPs, which is defined by irregular changes multimodality and discrete Pareto optimal sets (PSs) or fronts (PFs), makes the optimisation process significantly more complex. Finally, algorithms often face tight time constraints when responding to environmental changes. These time limits on DMOPs require algorithms to balance diversity and convergence effectively. This balance allows them to deal with environmental changes promptly and closely track time-varying PSs or PFs. These challenges underline the need to develop more complex and comprehensive test problems. Doing so will encourage the creation of innovative methodologies to overcome these difficulties.<br/><br/>
Benchmark problems are highly significant to algorithm analysis, enabling algorithm designers and practitioners to gain a clearer understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of evolutionary algorithms. In dynamic multi-objective optimisation, several widely used test suites exist, including FDA, dMOP and JY. However, these problem suites oversimplify the complexity of variations in real-world problems, capturing only specific facets of actual scenarios. For instance, the FDA and dMOP functions pose no detection challenges for algorithms. Environmental changes in these problems can be readily identified through a single re-evaluation of a random population member, which is far simpler than real-life environmental shifts. It is also acknowledged that most existing dynamic multi-objective optimisation problems (DMOPs) are direct adaptations of popular static test suites, such as ZDT and DTLZ. Consequently, these DMOPs exhibit considerable similarity in their problem characteristics, making them of limited value for comprehensive algorithm analysis. Furthermore, a concerning feature of most existing DMOPs is that static problem properties dominate over the dynamic elements to an excessive degree. A problem property, such as strong variable dependency, that presents challenges for static multi-objective optimisation may not be well-suited to dynamic multi-objective optimisation. One key reason is that algorithmic underperformance on DMOPs often stems from the static property rather than the presence of dynamics. Using such DMOPs can therefore lead to misleading inferences about algorithm performance. Additionally, most benchmark designs are founded on the premise that environments remain similar before and after a change. In real-world contexts, however, many DMOPs involve erratic environmental shifts. In such cases, the search directions employed by EAs for the current environment may be unsuitable for the new one, particularly when the PS of the new environment diverges substantially from, and in the worst-case scenario, even points in the opposite direction to, that of the current environment. In summary, a suite of diverse and unbiased benchmark test problems is urgently needed in the field to support the systematic investigation of evolutionary algorithms.<br/><br/>
<br/><br/>
<b>Competition Guideline</b>
<br/>
<br/>
In this competition, a total of 20 benchmark functions are introduced [1-5], covering representative types of DMOPs (continuous, and constrained) with diverse properties found in various real-world scenarios, such as irregular changes of PS or PF, time-dependent PF/PS geometries, disconnectivity, degeneration, detectability, and a changing number of decision variables and/or objective functions. Through suggesting a set of benchmark functions with a good representation of various real-world scenarios, we aim to promote the research on evolutionary dynamic multiobjective optimisation. All the benchmark functions have been implemented in MATLAB code.<br/>
<br/>
<strong>The benchmarks used for competition are detailed in the following technical report <a href="CEC2025-DMO-technical-report.docx" download>download here</a></strong>, which includes the necessary information to understand the problem, how the solutions are represented, and how the fitness function is evaluated. Please contact Dr Xiaozhong Yu. (xzyu@smail.xtu.edu.cn) if you encounter any problem.
<br/>
<br/>
There are three tracks of competition, briefly described as follows:<br/><br/>
Track 1: Dynamic Unconstrained Multi-Objective Optimisation<br/><br/>
Track 2: Dynamic Constrained Multi-Objective Optimisation<br/><br/>
Please feel free to choose either one or multiple tracks for competition. However, you should make a separate submission for each track you have chosen.<br/><br/>

<strong>All the benchmark functions have been implemented in MATLAB code (download <a href="https://github.com/yxz996/CEC2025DMOP" target="_self">here</a>)</strong>.<strong>Source code for sampling on the PF is also provided (download <a href="https://github.com/yxz996/CEC2025DMOP" target="_self">here</a>)</strong>.Please note that, the sampled points of PF should be truncated properly to guarantee uniformity (the k-nearest neighbor method in SPEA2 could be used for this purpose). Your results of the competition can be submitted in the form of a brief technical report, which should be sent directly to Dr Xiaozhong Yu. Submissions in both forms will be considered as entries, therefore be ranked according to the competition evaluation criteria.<br/><br/>
